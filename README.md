# iOS Wunderground Barometer Test

6 November 2012
--

This is a sample iOS app that demonstrates:

1. Using CoreLocation.framework to determine a device's location;
2. Establishing a connection with wunderground.com to retrieve weather information in JSON format for that location;
3. Parsing the JSON output; and
4. Updating the iOS app user interface with the barometer information.

Note, this assumes that you have a Wunderground "key id" for your app by visiting http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/?ref=twc
